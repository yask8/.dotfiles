# My Dotfiles
These are my dotfile configuration files for different software in Bash.
## .vimrc
This is my custom .vimrc configuration for Vim.
## .bashrc
This is my custom .bashrc configuration for Bash.

## Makefile, .virmc, .bashr custom
The newer files may not be coded correctly. The makefile is supposed to have targets which should run concisely, however they do not. The previous .virmc is more legible compared to the current .virmc this newer code should change many aesthetic settings, the bashrc custom is supposed to have many allias which is accurate but needs a package for them to run correctly. This code is not the best, but I wanted to showcase my mistakes to learn from them in the future.
